Hello, I'm Nate and welcome to my account!

I am a data professional and enjoy creating/learning/exploring different technologies and methods/models to increase my knowledge base.

What I am interested in:
- Methods to apply computational statistics to the business world
- Automation, 'cause who wants to do stuff manually?

What you will see here:

- Applied Statistical/DS projects (I am working towards my MS in Applied Statistics at RIT)
- Useful functions that I build out and would like other people to explore (and yes, critique. How else am I going to get better?!)
- Collaborative projects and personal portfolio, which will probably encompass all the above

You can reach me through LinkedIn, which you can access via this link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nswatanabe/
